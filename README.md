# Assessing the Effectiveness of VPD Bike Theft Prevention Programs

## Introduction

Bike theft is a prominent issue in Vancouver, with over 2,000 bikes stolen annually (VPD). The Vancouver Police Department partnered with Project 529 to implement a theft recovery and deterrent system, reportedly effective. Our study aims to statistically assess this effectiveness by comparing bike theft proportions in 2012 and 2022.

### Dataset
